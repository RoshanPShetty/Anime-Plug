# About
Anime Senpai is an open source REST API created that servers thousands of underrated anime. It is built with:

* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Express](https://expressjs.com/) 
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) 

# Background
I started Anime Senpai as a side project in first week of April, 2021 because of 
the frustration of not finding a single API service that provides underrated anime. 
So I created Anime Senpai that would help the community to feel some underappreciated works of art. 
I created the entire API from scratch.

# Support
This project is completely free to use and it's solely maintained by me, from front-end to back-end to frequent database updates, which takes a lot of my time. That is also the reason I stopped maintaining it for a long time. So to keep the API free forever, please consider donating. That would be greatly appreciated.
